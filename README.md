<h1>Weather Prediction</h1>
<p>
   The Weather Prediction repository contains the code and resources for an application that predicts upcoming weather using AI models KNN and Naive Bayes.<br>
   This application is built in Python programming language using Pycharm and demonstrates advanced knowledge in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Graphical Representation.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To build and run this project, you need to have the following tools installed</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Python 3.0 or above</li>
   <li>Pycharm IDE</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
   <li>
      Clone or download the repository to your local machine
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Nitzantomer1998/WeatherPrediction.git</code></pre>
   </li>
   <li>Open the project in Pycharm IDE</li>
   <li>Run the program to predict the upcoming weather</li>
   <li>You can also generate a graph that shows a comparison between models</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Predicts upcoming weather using KNN and Naive Bayes AI models</li>
   <li>Provides different models
      <ul>
         <li>Library Based
            <ul>
               <li>K Nearest Neighbors: Uniform & Weighted</li>
               <li>Naive Bayes: Estimate Gaussian Prior & 1/k Gaussian Prior</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Code Based
            <ul>
               <li>K Nearest Neighbors: Weighted</li>
               <li>Naive Bayes: Estimate Gaussian Prior</li>
               <li>KNN NB Fusion: Fusion</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Generates a graph that shows a comparison between models</li>
   <li>The code is well-organized and commented to make it easy to understand and follow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
   <li>The application is limited to the parameters of precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, and wind</li>
   <li>Some functionality may be limited due to the scope of the project</li>
   <li>The accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality of the input data and the models used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement more AI models for weather prediction</li>
  <li>Use additional parameters for more accurate weather predictions</li>
  <li>Add the ability to remove or modify the input data</li>
  <li>Provide a user-friendly GUI for easy use and navigation</li>
  <li>Integrate real-time data for more accurate and up-to-date predictions</li>
  <li>Allow the user to customize the appearance of the generated graph</li>
  <li>Create a feature to predict weather for different regions and cities</li>
  <li>Implement a weather forecasting system that provides updates and notifications for upcoming weather changes</li>
</ul>
